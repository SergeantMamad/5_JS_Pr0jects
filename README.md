## 5. Custom Scrollbar
This app comes to me by one of my co-workers in our team. The task is simple, Creating a custom scrollbar that replaces the default browser scrollbar. it has some bugs (sometimes it dosent scroll completely to the end or the thumb of the scrollbar goes outside of scrollbar). It works with scrolling with mouse and by dragging it.
